## Automatic installation

## Manual installation

### Gitea

import giteaEnv from "/src/code/gitea/.gitea.env?raw";

export const highlightGitea = [{ range: "1-9" }];

<Steps>

1.  In your crackito folder you can find a `.gitea.env` file:

        <FileTree>

        - crackito
            - docker-compose.yml
            - **.gitea.env**
            - ...

        </FileTree>

    In the following folder, you must edit the `.gitea.env` file

    <Code code={giteaEnv} lang="toml" title=".gitea.env" mark={highlightGitea} showLineNumbers />

    It is important to complete the highlighted lines, the database values must be the same as in `docker-compose.yml`.

2.  Now we can do

    ```bash
    $ docker compose up gitea db-gitea  -d
    ```

3.  We can now create an administrator user for Gitea
    ```bash
    $ docker exec --user git gitea gitea admin user create --admin --username $USERNAME --password $PASSWORD --email $EMAIL
    ```
    Replace each variable with its value. After that, you can access your Gitea panel and log in with the specified `$USERNAME` and `$PASSWORD`.

</Steps>

### Woodpecker

:::note
Before installing woodpecker, you must be sure that [Gitea](#gitea) is correctly running and configured
:::

import woodpeckerEnv from "/src/code/woodpecker/.woodpecker.env?raw";
import woodpeckerCompose from "/src/code/woodpecker/docker-compose.yml?raw";
import giteaConfigWoodpecker from "/src/assets/woodpecker/gitea configuration.png";
import giteaSecretWoodpecker from "/src/assets/woodpecker/gitea secret.png";

<Steps>
1.  Go to admin user application setting https://YOUR_GITEA_URL/user/settings/applications

    Create new OAuth2 Application, with the following value:
    <Image src={giteaConfigWoodpecker} alt="" />

    If your woodpecker is hosted on https://woodpecker.example.com, then the redirect url will be https://woodpecker.example.com/authorize


    After creating the application, gitea will generate client ID and client Secret
    :::caution
    Keep the client secret for Woodpecker, if you lose it, you will have to regenerate it
    :::
    <Image src={giteaSecretWoodpecker} alt="" />

2.  Now, you set all value in .woodpecker.env file

    <FileTree>

        - crackito
            - docker-compose.yml
            - **.woodpecker.env**
            - ...

    </FileTree>

    <Code code={woodpeckerEnv} lang="yml" title=".woodpecker.env" />

    `WOODPECKER_ADMIN` must be same as the gitea admin username

    The `WOODPECKER_AGENT_SECRET` must be same as in `woodpecker-agent` service

    <Code code={woodpeckerCompose} lang="yml" title="docker-compose.yml" showLineNumbers mark={7} />

3.  Now we can do

    ```bash
    $ docker compose up woodpecker-server woodpecker-agent  -d
    ```

</Steps>
